==================== CRITICAL INSTRUCTION ====================
KEYWORD: {keyword}
ANALYZE: {keyword}
STOP ASKING FOR INPUT
YOUR KEYWORD IS: {keyword}
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST
THIS IS YOUR ASSIGNMENT
================================================================

DO NOT:
- Ask for a keyword
- Wait for user input
- Request specification
- Question the keyword
- Ask user to choose
- Request keyword number
- Seek clarification

EXECUTE NOW with keyword "{keyword}":

THREE STEPS MUST BE COMPLETED:

Step 1: FETCH DATA
- Call get_indian_organic_results(keyword="{keyword}")
- Store the FULL API response (do not filter or modify)

Step 2: SAVE RAW DATA WITH UNIQUE FILENAME
- Call save_output_file with:
  - content=raw_json_from_api
  - filename="rank_profiler_{keyword}"
- This creates a UNIQUE file: rank_profiler_{keyword}.json
- This preserves the original SERPAPI data

Step 3: GENERATE COMPLETE STRUCTURED OUTPUT
- IMPORTANT: This is the FINAL DELIVERABLE
- Transform the SERPAPI results into RankProfilerOutput JSON
- MUST include ALL 13 fields (do not skip any):

1. metadata - REQUIRED
   {{timestamp: ISO8601, keyword: "{keyword}", agent_name: "rank_profiler", version: "1.0", tool: "SERPAPI"}}

2. search_parameters - REQUIRED
   {{engine: "google", query: "{keyword}", domain: "google.co.in", language: "en", geo: "IN"}}

3. search_information - REQUIRED
   {{results_state: "success"/"no_results", query_displayed: string, total_results: int, search_time: float}}

4. keyword - REQUIRED
   String value: "{keyword}"

5. organic_results - REQUIRED
   Array of top 10 results with: position, title, link, snippet, featured (boolean)

6. featured_snippet - REQUIRED (can be null)
   If SERPAPI has featured_snippet, include it. Otherwise set to null.

7. pagination - REQUIRED (can be null)
   If SERPAPI has pagination, include next/previous URLs. Otherwise set to null.

8. related_searches - REQUIRED (can be null or empty array)
   Array of related search queries from SERPAPI

9. top_3_competitors - REQUIRED
   Array with EXACTLY 3 items from top 3 results:
   {{rank: 1-3, domain: extracted, title: string, url: string, snippet: string, authority_score: 0-100}}

10. competitor_analysis - REQUIRED
    Array analyzing top 3 competitors:
    {{domain: string, total_keywords_analyzed: 0-10, positions_held: [array], estimated_domain_authority: 0-100, estimated_backlinks_strength: "VERY_HIGH"/"HIGH"/"MEDIUM"/"LOW"/"VERY_LOW"}}

11. ranking_insights - REQUIRED
    Array of 3-5 insights:
    {{keyword: "{keyword}", insight_type: enum, description: string, confidence: 0-100, recommended_action: string}}
    Insight types: "MARKET_SATURATION", "OPPORTUNITY", "COMPETITOR_WEAKNESS", "CONTENT_GAP", "TREND"

12. market_saturation_level - REQUIRED
    String enum: "LOW" or "MEDIUM" or "HIGH"
    LOW = few competitors, easy to rank
    MEDIUM = mixed competition
    HIGH = dominated by strong domains

13. opportunity_score - REQUIRED
    Float 0-100
    100 = very easy to rank (no competition)
    75-99 = easy (small competitors)
